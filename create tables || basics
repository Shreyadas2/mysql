--- here you'll get an idea of how tables are created

CREATE TABLE tablename(
  table_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  firstname VARCHAR(250),
  lastname VARCHAR(250),
  date DATE);;

PRIMARY KEY - Unique identifier among all unique ones. There's a known line "All Primary key are Unique Keys but all Unique Keys are not primary Key". 
Datatypes in SQL:
1. CHAR(SIZE): A fixed length string with length of characters ranges from(0 - 255), By default we take 1. 
Generally we don't use this datatype because of it's fixed nature in their size, like if its char(20) then 
20 blocks will be fixed whether the name contains 20 string characters or not.
2. VARCHAR(SIZE): A variable length character can contain number, letter or  special character ranges from(0 - 65535).
We generally use this as its not fixed in nature.
3.
